      SPRING BOOT DEVELOPMENT 

ðŸŒ± Introduction to Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework designed to simplify the development of web applications and microservices. It is built on top of the Spring Framework, and it helps developers build production-ready applications quickly with less configuration.

âœ… Why Spring Boot?

Traditional Spring applications require a lot of setup:

    Configuring XML files

    Setting up external servers (like Tomcat)

    Manually connecting components

Spring Boot removes all this pain by:

    Providing automatic configuration

    Using embedded servers (no need to deploy WAR files)

    Reducing boilerplate code

    Helping you build REST APIs and full web apps easily
